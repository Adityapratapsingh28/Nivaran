<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Problem Statement

The healthcare system faces challenges in timely, accurate diagnoses, especially where expertise is limited. Patients struggle to navigate care, and doctors may struggle to identify conditions with limited information. Traditional methods are often time-consuming, costly, and unreliable, leading to delayed treatment and suboptimal outcomes.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Key Features ðŸ¤–
- Plant disease prediction

   - Our Deep learning model will take the image of plant from user and predict the disease from which thbe plant is suffering from.

- Fertilizer analysis summarization

   - NLP model using webscrapping and month on month sentimental analysis on amazon reviews of each year given by user and it will provide the summary of all the reviews so the farmer can get a idea that how is the product is that product is going to help him or not.
 
- Multilingual website

   - Our website is available on three languages right now that are hindi , english & tamil. This will provide ease of communication and readability to farmers.
 
- Farmers laws/schemes

- Website Interface: 

  - User-friendly website interface for easy interaction and navigation.
 
- Enhanced Model Training:

  - Our deep learning model is trained and tested and the accuracy is 98% , while our summarization analysis model is also performing good.
